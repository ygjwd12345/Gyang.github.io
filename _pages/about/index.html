I belong to <a href="http://en.iil.ac.cn/default.aspx" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Integrative Intelligence and Learning(IIL) lab</a>, where principal investigator is <a href="http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wangmengzuo?lang=zh" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wangmeng Zuo</a>. I received my Ph.D. degree in 2023 from the Cognitive Science Department at HIT under the supervision of Prof. Mingli Ding. I was also a joint Ph.D. student in 2020-2022 at University of Trento under the co-supervision of Prof. <a href="https://eliricci.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Elisa Ricci</a>. I received the B.S. degree from the Measurement ＆ Control Technology and Instrument Department, from HIT in 2016.</p> <p><strong>Research Interests</strong>: My research endeavors are anchored in the design and development of robust and scalable visual recognition systems, with a keen focus on their application in real-world scenarios. Central to my academic pursuit is the exploration of contrastive learning, unsupervised and semi-supervised learning methodologies, and domain adaptation techniques. These areas are pivotal in refining the accuracy and efficiency of various visual tasks, including but not limited to object retrieval, image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. In the realm of autonomous driving and anomaly detection, my work seeks to integrate these advanced visual recognition strategies, underscoring their potential to revolutionize these fields. This integration not only promises enhancements in system reliability and performance but also contributes to the broader discourse on intelligent system design and implementation.</p> </body></html>
